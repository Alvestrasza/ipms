# IPMS Agent

The IPMS Agent is a native C++20 service for customer-managed Windows and Linux systems. It will establish an outbound, mutually authenticated connection to the IPMS Control Plane and collect only capabilities explicitly assigned to the enrolled device.

The initial implementation contains the pack registry and the read-only `windows-server-core` pack. The Windows executable can run in an interactive diagnostic mode with `--console` or as the `IPMS Agent` Windows service. It does not yet enroll, persist data, or send inventory to a Control Plane; those operations remain deliberately blocked until the enrollment and transport contracts are implemented.

## Build

Build with a current CMake release and a C++20 compiler. On Windows, use a Developer PowerShell for Visual Studio:

```powershell
cmake -S agent -B build/agent -G Ninja
cmake --build build/agent --config Release
ctest --test-dir build/agent --output-on-failure
```

The Windows target links only Windows SDK libraries. No package manager, runtime download, or third-party dependency is required for this foundation.

## Windows installation

Run the versioned installer from an elevated PowerShell after verifying the
release artifact signature and hash. The script refuses to overwrite an
existing service and uses the Windows service default `LocalSystem` account.

```powershell
.\agent\scripts\install-windows-agent.ps1 -BinaryPath .\build\agent\ipms-agent.exe -WhatIf
.\agent\scripts\install-windows-agent.ps1 -BinaryPath .\build\agent\ipms-agent.exe
Get-CimInstance Win32_Service -Filter "Name='IPMS Agent'" | Select-Object Name, StartName, State
```

The uninstall script removes only the service registration; it deliberately
does not delete binaries, certificates, or future agent state.

## Security boundary

The Windows service is designed to run as LocalSystem because read-only host and Hyper-V inventory can require privileged Windows APIs. LocalSystem is not permission to execute server-supplied commands. Management Packs are signed, versioned declarations that activate built-in capabilities only; they never contain executable code, PowerShell, or arbitrary command lines.
